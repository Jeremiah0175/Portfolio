# Project Background

Adistar Retail Group is a national retail chain that exclusively sells Adidas footwear, apparel, and accessories. Founded in 2012, Adistar operates a network of brick-and-mortar stores across multiple U.S. regions and a growing direct-to-consumer e-commerce channel.

The company’s business model focuses on delivering a premium brand experience, optimizing inventory allocation across channels, and maximizing margin through targeted pricing and promotional strategies.

**Sales Channel & Margin Analysis:** Evaluates online, in-store, and outlet performance to determine which channels drive the highest sales and profit margins.

**Product Category Performance:** Analyzes sales and profitability across footwear and apparel categories to uncover trends in customer demand and pricing effectiveness.

**Retailer & Operational Efficiency:** Reviews partner and store-level performance to assess contribution to overall revenue, profitability, and operational consistency.
